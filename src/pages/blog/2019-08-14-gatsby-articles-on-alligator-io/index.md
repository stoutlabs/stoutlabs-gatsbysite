Wow, my last post was over six months ago â€” I've *really* been slacking with this blog! But to be fair, I have been **incredibly** busy. I should probably update my portfolio sometime soon. ðŸ¤£

Despite being so busy, I keep getting the urge to write about all the interesting things I'm learning about and using. I cannot fight it anymore, so I'm redesigning my blog and bringing it back to life very soon! Starting this week, I will be regularly writing *very small* instructional posts on topics from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), plain JavaScript, CSS, and more.

In the meanwhile, you should go check out the catalyst for this urge: my articles on Gatsby over at [Alligator.io](https://alligator.io)! So far, I've written the following posts:

* [Gatsby CLI Quick Reference](https://alligator.io/gatsbyjs/gatsby-cli-quick-reference/)
* [Using Airtable With Gatsby](https://alligator.io/gatsbyjs/using-airtable-with-gatsby/)
* [Adding Sitemapts to Gatsby Websites](https://alligator.io/gatsbyjs/adding-sitemaps-to-gatsby/)
* [Using Styled Components in Gatsby](https://alligator.io/gatsbyjs/using-styled-components-in-gatsbyjs/)
* Coming in the next day or two: a detailed intro to MDX with Gatsby!

Stay tuned for more over at Alligator.io, but also keep an eye out on my blog here! ðŸ‘€
