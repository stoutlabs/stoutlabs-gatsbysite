Ok, so I've been slacking with my personal development blog... but I have been **SUPER** busy! 

I'm bringing the blog back to life soon, but in the meanwhile you should go check out my articles on Gatsby over at Alligator.io!

So far, I've written the following posts:

* [Gatsby CLI Quick Reference](https://alligator.io/gatsbyjs/gatsby-cli-quick-reference/)
* [Using Airtable With Gatsby](https://alligator.io/gatsbyjs/using-airtable-with-gatsby/)
* [Adding Sitemapts to Gatsby Websites](https://alligator.io/gatsbyjs/adding-sitemaps-to-gatsby/)
* [Using Styled Components in Gatsby](https://alligator.io/gatsbyjs/using-styled-components-in-gatsbyjs/)
* Coming in the next day or two: a detailed intro to MDX with Gatsby!

Stay tuned for more over at Alligator.io, and also keep an eye out on my blog here! Starting this week, I plan to start regularly writing *very small* instructional posts on topics from Node, React, Gatsby, NextJS, plain JS, CSS, and more. ðŸ˜Ž
