As a business owner, having a fast website is a lot more important than you might realize. Whether browsing on a mobile device or desktop computer, the simple fact remains: nobody likes waiting around for pages to load.

According to a recent Google report, around 20% of online visitors are likely to **_abandon_** a website if a single page load takes just three seconds! And even worse, that rate rapidly increases with every additional 0.1 seconds of time. There's more I could mention here, but I really want to keep this as short and instructive – not long and boring.

### Want to Check Your Website Speed?

To run your own free website performance audit, you'll just need to be using the current version of Google Chrome browser. We'll be using a built-in tool called Lighthouse, which is an automated tool that tests website performance in several key areas.

To access it, just load up your website in Chrome and then launch the "Chrome Developer Tools". (In Windows, it's `ctrl+shift+I`) In the developer tools window, you should see a handful of tabs at the top: Elements, Console, Network, etc. Look for the one labeled 'Audits', and click on it.

From there, you can select whether you want to run a mobile or desktop test, what types of audits to run, and whether you want to "throttle" the connection. (This simulates a mobile 3G connection and/or a weaker mobile CPU, to mimic how your site performs on slower mobile connections/processors.)

Note: If you are running any extensions in your Chrome browser, they can have a negative effect on your results. You may want to do these tests from an "incognito" Chrome browser instead – as it won't load any of your extensions. (Feel free to get in touch with me if you need help doing this.)

### My Website Speed Results

Here's a look at my website's Lighthouse audit results. Notice how insanely fast it loads and is ready to "interact" with: 0.14 seconds and 0.39 seconds, respectively!
