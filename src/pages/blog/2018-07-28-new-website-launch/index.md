Welcome! This is just a quick announcement for the launch of my new JAMstack-powered StoutLabs.com. I have been _deep_ in the depths of self-learning a TON of JavaScript for the past few months, and this is actually the first live website example of it. So...I'm pretty stoked to **_officially_** begin a new chapter in my career and see where this new knowledge takes me.

### Quick Notes About the Site:

- This website was built with [GatsbyJS (v2 beta)](http://www.gatsbyjs.org), uses [Prismic.io](http://www.prismic.io) as a headless CMS, and is hosted on the amazing [Netlify.com](http://www.netlify.com). I absolutely LOVE this JAMstack combo, and will definitely be using it more and more! (No... really. I cannot say enough good things about all three of them!)
- To be honest, I didn't really spend a _ton_ of time on the design... mainly because I've been busy working on a separate GatsbyJS site for the past few few weeks. I'm also moving in the direction of doing less design and WAY more coding, as it is what I prefer. (I do have plans to come back soon and "polish" things up a bit, though.)
- For the same reasons, this site's source code may be a bit "messy" in places. Re-factoring to come! (I'll probably hold off on that until Gatsby v2 moves out of beta, though.)
