In this quick post, we'll go over two more widely used JavaScript array methods: `pop` and `push`.

## Array.pop Method

The [Array.pop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop) method in JavaScript "pops" the last element from an array and returns it. This _mutates_ (a.k.a. changes) the array that it's used on.

Here's an array of food emojis we will use in the examples below:

```js
const foodEmojis = ["🍕", "🥨", "🌮", "🍔"];
```

Let's remove the last element, and save it to a new variable:

```js
const removedItem = foodEmojis.pop();
```

The `removedItem` variable now contains 🍔, and the `foodEmojis` array contains:

```js
["🍕", "🥨", "🌮"];
```

Easy, right? 😎

## Array.push Method

The [Array.push](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop) method in JavaScript "pushes" one or more new elements on to the end of an array, and returns the new length. This method also mutates the array, obviously. 😄

Let's add the `removedItem`, a.k.a the hamburger (🍔), back to our array:

```js
foodEmojis.push(removedItem);
```

And then we'll add some cakes (🍰 & 🎂) to our array, because this stuff is a piece of cake:

```js
let arrayLength = foodEmojis.push("🍰", "🎂"); // result: 6
```
The final contents of `foodEmojis` would now be:

```js
[ "🍕", "🥨", "🌮", "🍔", "🍰", "🎂"]
```

Nice!

### YAJG: Yet Another JavaScript 'Gotcha!'

Don't forget, `Array.push` does not return the updated array - it returns the *_length_* of the updated array! (This is somewhat counterintuitive, and has tripped me up several times...ugh.)

## Final Words

Today's post was an extra short one... and there will be lots of these! This is part of my attempt to write VERY frequently, and sometimes I only have a few extra moments in my day. (Like today... 😅)

But don't worry: there will be plenty of longer/more complex posts coming, too! (I have a TON of cooler/more interesting stuff I want to write about... I just need the time. ⌚)
