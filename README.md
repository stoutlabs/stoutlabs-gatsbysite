# StoutLabs.com - Website

My GatsbyJS website! Built using the default Gatsby (v2) starter, and is loosely based on the [Strata template](https://html5up.net/strata) by HTML5up â€“ but with a tongue-in-cheek "cheesy dating site" theme.

Uses Prismic.io as a headless CMS, with gatsby-source-prismic to bring in the data.

## Other Features:

- Styled Components
- react-waypoint + react-scrollspy
- smoothscroll-polyfill for smooth scrolling
- SEO via react-helmet
- FontAwesome icons via react-fontawesome
- There's a mini-blog in here too, but it's not ready... so it's not really "live" yet.
- [Netlify.com](http://www.netlify.com) (amazing static site hosting)

### To-Do(s):

**_Note:_** The code is a bit messy in places...sorry! I will probably come back soon to clean up & refactor things a bit.
