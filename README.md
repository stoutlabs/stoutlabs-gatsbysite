# StoutLabs - Gatsby (v2) Site

My first live GatsbyJS site!

Built upon the default Gatsby (v2) starter, and loosely based on the [Strata template by HTML5up](https://html5up.net/strata). Also Uses Prismic.io for a headless CMS. JAMstack ftw! :)

## Other Features:

- Styled Components
- react-waypoint + react-scrollspy
- smoothscroll-polyfill for smooth scrolling
- Netlify (hosting)
- SEO via react-helmet
- Fontawesome 5.0 icons
