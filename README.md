# StoutLabs.com - GatsbyJS Website

My GatsbyJS website! Built using the default Gatsby (v2) starter, and is loosely based on the [Strata template](https://html5up.net/strata) by HTML5up â€“ but with a tongue-in-cheek "cheesy dating site" theme.

Uses Prismic.io as a headless CMS, with gatsby-source-prismic to bring in the data.

- smoothscroll-polyfill for smooth scrolling
- SEO via react-helmet
- FontAwesome icons via react-fontawesome (Switching to react-icons soon, though!)
- There's a blog in here, too. It is a constantly evolving WIP at this point. ðŸ˜„
