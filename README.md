# StoutLabs.com - GatsbyJS Website

My GatsbyJS website! Built using the default Gatsby (v2) starter, and is loosely based on the [Strata template](https://html5up.net/strata) by HTML5up â€“ but with a tongue-in-cheek "cheesy dating site" theme.

Uses Prismic.io as a headless CMS, with gatsby-source-prismic to bring in the data.

- There's a mini-blog in here too, but it's not ready... so it's not really "live" yet.
