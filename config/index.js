    I'm Daniel Stout, and I have provided professional freelance/contract web development and web design services nationwide
    since 2004! After several years of PHP-based development work, I made the move over to a full JavaScript "stack" in 2017. I now
    make use of (and really enjoy) amazing tools like React, Node, and Express. I'm available to help you or your company in many areas, 
    including: websites, tracked marketing/landing pages, progressive web apps (PWAs), email campaigns, automated bots, and much more!
