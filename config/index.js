    I'm Daniel Stout, and I have provided professional freelance/contract web development and web design services nationwide
    since 2004! After several years of PHP-based development work, I made the move over to a full JavaScript "stack" in 2017. I now
    make use of (and really enjoy) amazing tools like React and Node, and open source projects like Gatsby. I'm available to help you 
    or your company in many areas, including: websites, tracked marketing/landing pages, progressive web apps (PWAs), email campaigns, 
    automated bots, and much more!
