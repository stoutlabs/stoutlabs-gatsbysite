    I'm Daniel Stout, and I have provided professional freelance/contract web development and web design services nationwide since 2004! After several years of PHP-based development work, I made the move over to a full JavaScript "stack" in 2017. I now make use of (and really enjoy) amazing tools like React and Node, and open source projects like Gatsby. I'm available to help you and/or your company in many areas, including: web development, progressive web apps (PWAs), automated bots, and much more!
